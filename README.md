# slurm-spank-go

This is a repository that I use to test whether it is possible to have a Slurm SPANK plugin written in C+Golang. The part that links with Slurmis written in C, and the logic of the plugin is written in Go.

NOTE: Take this as a personal development repo, almost 100% not working or and most likely not worth replicating or trying to use in production. I am not a proficient developer in any language, and definitely not in C or Go, so there is also a big chance that some of the things I try here are either incorrect, or impossible to do :nerd_face:
